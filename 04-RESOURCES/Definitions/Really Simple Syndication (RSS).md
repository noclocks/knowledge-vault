## Overview

**RSS** is a *web feed* that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a [standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization"), computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single [news aggregator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator "News aggregator"), which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. News aggregators (or "RSS readers") can be built into a [browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application"), installed on a [desktop computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software"), or installed on a [mobile device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app "Mobile app").

Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog "Blog") entries, news headlines, episodes of audio and video series, or for distributing [podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast "Podcast"). An RSS document (called "feed", "web feed", like publishing date and author's name. RSS formats are specified using a generic [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") file.

Although RSS formats have evolved from as early as March 1999, it was between 2005 and 2006 when RSS gained widespread use, and the icon was decided upon by several major web browsers. RSS feed data is presented to users using software called a news aggregator and the passing of content is called [web syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication "Web syndication"). Users subscribe to feeds either by entering a feed's [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier "Uniform Resource Identifier") into the reader or by clicking on the browser's [feed icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed#Feed_icon "Web feed"). The RSS reader checks the user's feeds regularly for new information and can automatically download it, if that function is enabled.
