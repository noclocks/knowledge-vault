## Overview

- Python is free and open source with development coordinated through the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).
- Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one of the most commonly used programming languages.
- Popular textbooks on Python programming include [[Gut16](https://actuariesinstitute.github.io/cookbook/docs/zbibliography.html#id2 "John Guttag. Introduction to computation and programming using Python: With application to understanding data. MIT Press, 2016.")] and [[Hil16](https://actuariesinstitute.github.io/cookbook/docs/zbibliography.html#id3 "Christian Hill. Learning scientific programming with python. Cambridge University Press, 2016.")].

## Common Use Cases

Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains such as:

- communications
- web development
- CGI and graphical user interfaces
- game development
- multimedia, data processing, security, etc.

Python is beginner-friendly and routinely used to teach computer science and programming in top computer science programs.

Python is particularly popular within the scientific and data science communities.

It is steadily [replacing familiar tools like Excel](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/3002556/python-replaced-excel-banking) in the fields of finance and banking.
