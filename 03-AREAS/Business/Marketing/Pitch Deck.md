# Pitch Deck

> [!NOTE]
> The **pitch deck** is a crucial asset for startups looking to capture an audience's attention.

## Overview

A startup's pitch deck typically looks like a visual presentation, often accompanies by a product demonstration, that conveys how the company's innovative product or service will *disrupt an industry* and get investors a return on their investment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember: A winning startup pitch deck explains the problem that your innovation solves, describing in detail the pain points associated with that problem. Then, when you explain how your innovation is a solution, it should give investors that “aha” moment.

## Key Components

There are ~11 key components to a pitch deck:

1. Unique Value Proposition
2. Problem + Pain Points
3. Target Market
4. Solution
5. Business Model
6. Milestones
7. Sales Strategy
8. Team
9. Financials
10. Competition
11. FAQ

## Tips & Tricks

- Feature visual, kinesthetic, and auditory elements in your presentation
- Paint a visual picture or develop animations
- Invite the audience to be part of the conversation
- Take a walk with the audience, literally or metaphorically
