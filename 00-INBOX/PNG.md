PNG is a high-quality file format used for images. This file type is based on the [lossless compression](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/46333/lossless-compression), which means that it supports high-quality images for online use while retaining the original image colors and sharpness. Unlike JPEG files, PNGs also support images with transparent backgrounds. So, if you want to have an image without a background, like a logo or product, you can save it as a [PNG file](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/png-file) and use it with different backgrounds. However, this file is not as lightweight as a JPEG. Therefore, it’s not recommended to upload hundreds of large PNG’s to your website or portfolio as it will take up a lot of storage and ultimately increase the loading time of your site. And nobody has time for that.
