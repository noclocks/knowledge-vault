*Graphics Interchange Format*

You’ve probably heard of this file type based on its most popular feature that’s taken the Internet by storm: animation! The [GIF file](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blog-adding-media-to-a-blog-post) is a form of bitmap images, meaning the graphic is composed of many tiny parts called pixels, just like the JPEG and PNG file formats. This file type is based on [LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lzw-lempel-ziv-welch-compression-technique/), a special form of the lossless data compression algorithm. A GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with a few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, and logos, rather than gradients. For example, your business’ icons that contain three colors or less look great in this file format – plus, the small file size will be suitable to use anywhere. However, a beautiful sunset picture would not only be too heavy of a file size but also will look distorted because of the color limitations. One benefit of this file type is that it supports a transparent background, like a PNG file.
