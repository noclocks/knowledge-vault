*Scalable Vector Graphics*

SVG is a format commonly used to save and display vectors. Vector what? Vector art graphics are digital illustrations that are based on geometric shapes. They are created using a vector illustration software, like Illustrator. Apart from the clean and professional look they embody, their biggest advantage is that they maintain the highest quality even when resized. For example, if your business logo is a vector – and it should be – you can resize it to fit something as big as a billboard sign or as small as your business cards without risking a loss in quality. Today, we can view SVG images on all web browsers. It’s also a good format for printing purposes. So when you’re creating logos, icons and illustrations, make sure you save them as an [SVG file](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/svg-file). Also, if you’re working with designers on visual assets for your business, ask them to send it to you as an SVG file version, as well as other relevant formats (like PNG, JPEG, etc.).
