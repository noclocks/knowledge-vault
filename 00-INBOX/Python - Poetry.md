Poetry is a [[MOC - Python|Python]] tool for managing dependencies and packaging, providing a straightforward workflow and ensuring reproducible builds with its `poetry.lock` file. 

In a [[Python REPL]], `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` are automatically included for easy project setup and management.

The `pyproject.toml` file provides a centralized location for storing project configuration and metadata, making managing project settings and dependencies easier. The `poetry.lock` file is used by the Poetry dependency management tool to lock the dependencies of a project to specific versions.
