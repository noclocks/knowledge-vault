`JPEG` is the most common format used by digital cameras and images living on the World Wide Web. This file format is based on [lossy compression](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/46335/lossy-compression), meaning that it keeps information that is visible to the viewer and gets rid of data that the human eye can’t perceive. The popularity of the [JPEG file](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/jpeg-file) stems from the fact that it is lightweight, while still being good enough quality for digital use. Due to its size, it will not only load faster, but it can be uploaded to any platform regardless of size limitations. This format can also be viewed on any device without the need to download a special image viewer. However, it’s important to be aware that every time you save a file as a JPEG, hence compressing it over and over again, it causes the image to lose quality and possibly become pixelated or grainy.
