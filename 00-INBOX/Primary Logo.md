> [!NOTE] Primary Logo
> A primary logo is the main logo used to represent your brand. All other brand logos stem from this primary logo design.

Primary logos are typically horizontal, and the most comprehensive of all brand designs. Any tagline(s), established dates, illustrations, icons, locations, etc., usually make their way into this grandeur logo.

Your primary logo design needs lots of space because of its intricacies and size. Use your main logo in places where it has plenty of room to breathe and isnâ€™t restricted by space.

**Placements**: Desktop website header, large print collateral (e.g., signs).
