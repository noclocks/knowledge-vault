> [!NOTE] Secondary Logo
> Depending on your industry, a secondary logo can be vertical or horizontal. Alternate secondary logos tend to be stripped-down, stacked versions of your primary logo.

Your secondary logo is also known as an alternate logo. Think of it in terms of sports: If my primary player were out due to an injury (e.g., your primary logo can’t fit in the desired location), I’d put in an _alternate_.

I tend to remove any creative elements or taglines from secondary logo designs and focus on the brand name (also known as a wordmark logo).

A vertical secondary logo works well on hang tags for clothing brands, while a horizontal version is great for smaller print collateral pieces.

**Placements:** Business cards, invoices.
