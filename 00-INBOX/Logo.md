### File Formats

You’ll want to have your logo design saved in vector files, such as [PDF](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/portable-document-format-pdf) or [SVG](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/svg-file/), which are optimal for scalability. Vector files can serve as the master copy of your design and can be easily reformatted or resized to other file formats such as [JPGs](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/jpeg-file) or PNGs, without losing quality.

You can read up on [different types of files](https://www.wix.com/blog/different-types-of-files) to understand which one is right for specific purposes. In general, [PNG](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/png-file) is the best format for digital spaces because it’s transparent, making it much more adaptable.

### Resolution

Here is a quick overview of some basic resolution concepts:
  
- PPI (pixels per inch) refers to how many pixels will appear in a single inch of any digital screen. PPI, also known as pixel density, is used to measure the clarity of images. The higher the PPI, the greater the detail will appear in the image.  
- DPI (dots per inch) is another way to measure clarity, but on paper. This is an important measurement for any printed versions of your logo, as it will determine the dots of ink.  
- Resolution is the total number of pixels that will appear on the screen. It is always measured in both width and height, so it will always be written as 500 x 500 px, for example.  
- Bytes refer to the actual file size and can be measured in kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB).

## Website Logos

Having your logo on your website is a great way to instantly greet your visitors, and let them experience your brand right from the first click. Whether you use it in your header (sometimes called the navigation bar), or favicon (the small icon that sits in the search bar tab next to your URL), your logo represents your brand wherever users are within your site.

Remember, you'll also have visitors to your mobile site who view it on their smartphones or tablets, where your logo may appear even smaller. Ensuring you have the highest quality image will create an optimal user experience.

In general, for online purposes, your logo size should be under 200 KB. The larger your image file is, the heavier it is, which makes it more challenging for websites.

### Header

- [[SVG]] Recommended
- Transparent Background

When using your logo in your website header, keep these things in mind:

- **Placement**: Left-aligned is the most common and recommended option for logos in headers. 
	- This is especially true for websites in languages that read left-to-right. Center-aligned logos may also work, depending on your overall layout and design. 
- **Hyperlink Home**: Be sure to link your logo back to your homepage to optimize user experience.
- **Use Logo Elsewhere**: While the header and favicon are the most popular places to use your logo on your website, you can also include it in your footer, designed into buttons or icons, or even integrated into your product pages.

In general, website logos can be any size, however the recommended logo dimensions for a web page are:
- `250px x 150px`

Remember that your logo will not take up the entire width of a website, banner or layout, rather it should be included in the overall design.

In logo design, the term "dimension" refers to the physical size of the logo, usually measured in width and height. 

The dimensions of a logo are crucial considerations because they determine how the logo will appear across different applications, platforms, and media.
