*Portable Document Format*

This file format is used for online documents and printing purposes. It was created by Adobe with the goal of displaying files in the same format, no matter what device they are viewed on or what software they are opened with. Thanks to the reliability of PDFs you can create long documents and share them with others without risking a loss to your original design – text is not larger, images are not smaller, etc. [PDF files](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/portable-document-format-pdf) can contain many different elements: text, photos, vector images, videos, audio files and even interactive elements like forms and buttons. It’s possible to create this file using many different kinds of software, from Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, and Acrobat to Microsoft Word, Google Docs and more. But to be able to view a PDF, you need to have a PDF reader installed on your device.
