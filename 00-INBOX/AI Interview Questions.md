### 1. Explain Artificial Intelligence and Give Examples of its Applications.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of Computer Science focuses on creating systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding natural language, making decisions, and learning. We use AI to build various applications, including image and speech recognition, [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]], [[Robotics]], and [[Machine Learning]] models like [[Neural Networks]].

### 2. How are Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Related?

Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are closely related but distinct fields within the broader domain of computer science. AI includes not only machine learning but also other approaches, like rule-based systems, expert systems, and knowledge-based systems, which do not necessarily involve learning from data. Many state-of-the-art AI systems are built upon machine learning techniques, as these approaches have proven to be highly effective in tackling complex, data-driven problems.

### 3. What is Deep Learning Based On?

[[Deep Learning]] is a subfield of [[Machine Learning]] that focuses on the development of artificial [[neural networks]] with multiple layers, also known as [[deep neural networks]]. These networks are particularly effective in modeling complex, hierarchical patterns and representations in data. *[[Deep Learning]] is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, specifically the biological neural networks that make up the brain.*

### 4. How many Layers are in a Neural Network?

[[Neural Networks]] are one of many types of ML algorithms that are used to model complex patterns in data. They are composed of **three** layers:

1. Input Layer
2. Hidden Layer
3. Output Layer

### 5. Explain TensorFlow

[[TensorFlow]] is an [[open source]] platform developed by [[Google]] designed primarily for high-performance numerical computation. It offers a collection of workflows that can be used to develop and train models to make machine learning robust and efficient. [TensorFlow](https://www.turing.com/kb/building-neural-network-in-tensorflow) is customizable, and thus, helps developers create experiential learning architectures and work on the same to produce desired results.

### 6. What are some Pros and Cons of Cognitive Computing?

[[Cognitive Computing]] is a type of [[AI]] that mimics human thought processes. We use this form of computing to solve problems that are complex for traditional computer systems. 

Some major benefits of cognitive computing are:

- It is the combination of technology that helps to understand human interaction and provide answers.    
- Cognitive computing systems acquire knowledge from the data.
- These computing systems also enhance operational efficiency for enterprises.

### 7. What's the Difference Between NLP and NLU?

[[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] and [[Natural Language Understanding (NLU)]] are two closely related subfields within the broader domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. Although they are often used interchangeably, they emphasize different aspects of language processing.

NLP deals with the development of algorithms and techniques that enable computers to process, analyze, and generate human language. NLP covers a wide range of tasks, including text analysis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarization, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and more. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to effectively handle text and speech data, extract useful information, and generate human-like language outputs.

While, NLU is a subset of NLP that focuses specifically on the comprehension and interpretation of meaning from human language inputs. NLU aims to disambiguate the nuances, context, and intent in human language, helping machines grasp not just the structure but also the underlying meaning, sentiment, and purpose. NLU tasks may include sentiment analysis, question-answering, intent recognition, and semantic parsing.
