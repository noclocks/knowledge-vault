## Raster Files

> [!NOTE] Raster Files
> Raster files are your traditional pixel based image files (gif, jpg, png). These images are created via colored dots (pixels) on a grid.

- "Image size" refers to your images dimensions (measured in inches or pixels), whereas the "image resolution" refers to the“crispness” of a raster image file (measured in DPI: "Dots Per Inch").
- It is important to note that, while the dimensions and resolution are related to the size of the image file, an images file size is measured in bytes (kilo-, mega-, giga-, etc).

Resolution of an image as it refers to “crispness” on a webpage – Generally speaking a good image resolution for your website is going to be around 72 – 96 dpi. You can get away with a lower resolution image on the web because they have a smaller file size (which will make your webpage load faster) and because the size of the pixels on your screen don't change.

When you look at any screen, you’re looking at a grid of pixels. The lower resolution screen you have, the larger the graphics and text will appear, because your pixels are larger.

- Example: If you were looking at two 17inch screens and one had a resolution of 1920x1080 while the other had a resolution of 1600x900 the graphics on the second screen would appear bigger because there are fewer pixels covering the same ground, so those pixels have to be larger.
